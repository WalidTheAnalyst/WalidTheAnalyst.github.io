									<h2>An Empirical Approach to Understanding India’s Emergence as a Global Powerhouse</a></h2>

								<h4>Abstract</h4>
                                <p>Since the 1990s, globalization has played a central role in shaping the economic health of all countries, inter-linking them all through foreign labor markets and trade. Integration in today’s globalized world is especially important for countries with large populations, and therefore, large labor and human capital potential that can be exploited to gain an economic edge; India is a prime example. The key research question that this empirical paper seeks to investigate is “How has India’s GDP share of imports influenced its economic development measured in GDP per capita?”. The empirical method employed to determine the causal relationship between India’s GDP share of imports – a measure of its integration in the global economy – and its economic development is an Instrumental Variable (IV) analysis. Using data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) and the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) databases, this research paper finds that an increase in India’s GDP share of imports results in a corresponding increase in its GDP per capita over time. However, after controlling for population this evidence is not present and results indicate that an increase in India’s GDP share of imports does not result in an increase in GDP per capita. These findings go against our hypothesis.</p>

                                    <h4> Abstract</h4>
                                    <p>This paper examines the rule of first possession, which awards ownership to the first to claim, against the rule of tied ownership, which binds property rights to certain conditions. Through economic, social, and legal lenses, we analyze each rule's effectiveness in promoting resource utilization, investment incentives, and conflict resolution. The first rule's tendency to prompt preemptive investments and potential social inefficiency is contrasted with the second rule's capacity to mitigate such issues, albeit with implementation challenges. We propose a combined framework that leverages the benefits of both rules, encouraging innovation and stewardship while addressing fairness and sustainability. Our findings suggest that a blended approach could lead to more balanced and progressive property rights policies.</p>
